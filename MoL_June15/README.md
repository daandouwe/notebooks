Code base for June project on PCFG sampling.

You should check the labs in this order

* CFG
* CKY
* Inference 

You can also import basic data structures from the several python modules.

We now have two grammars for performing arithmetic operations: one that is unambiguous and an ambiguous one.
Follow `lab-inference` to learn more about interesting problems involving ambiguous PCFGs.

# Dependencies
